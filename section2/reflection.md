## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
* No one is born with a particular skill. Developing your abilities takes lots of practice.
* Mistakes are key to learning, and being afraid to make them will limit your ability to develop your skills.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I am learning to be comfortable being uncomfortable and not knowing everything. I am comfortable asking questions. However, I sometimes get frustrated if I don't understand something right away. I sometimes feel like I will never understand something if I don't immediately get it.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
I felt comfortable with this section. I appreciated that we were told where to find the information we needed, even if we weren't given it outright. I like that we are being taught how to find information and not just given it.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
A conditional statement checks to see if a condition is true (or false) and then executes an action based on the result. In daily life I might say:
* If I am sleepy in the morning, I will brew a pot of coffee.

In a web application, an example conditional might be:
* If a user is logged in, the application will show their friends list.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
You can use `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to use multiple conditions. The syntax looks like:
```javascript
if (some condition) {
  <execute a command>;
} else if (another condition){
  <execute a command>;
} else {
  <execute a command>
};
```
The program will check to see if the `if` statement is true. If so, it will execute the code attached to the conditional. If not, it will check to see if the `else if` statement is true. If so, it will execute that code. If not, it will execute the code in the `else` statement.


6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
To check if two conditions are true, you can use the `&&` (and) logical operator. This operator checks to see if both conditions are met. If you want to see if 1 of 2 conditions are met, you can use the `||` (or) logical operator. 


7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
I feel like I understand the basics well, but I want to know more about how to handle a situation where there might be many conditions. Are there ways to simplify the syntax or handle more complicated conditions?
